## Mission

Personalize learning using Neo4j graph pattern matching and cluster analytics.

## Reusability Architecture (Critical)

**NOT storing per-student raw data** (causes explosion):
```
❌ student_001_attempts: [all raw data]
❌ student_002_attempts: [all raw data]
❌ ... 10,000 students × 1,000 problems = 10M records
```

**Storing patterns + aggregates** (reusable):
```
✅ PerformanceCluster: {avg_time: 115, success_rate: 0.82}
✅ Student references cluster
✅ 100 clusters × 10,000 students = efficient
```

## Core Operations

### 1. Classify Student into Cluster

```cypher
// Analyze student's attempt patterns:
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})-[a:ATTEMPTED]->(p:Problem)
      -[:USES_PATTERN]->(pattern:ScaffoldPattern)
WITH s, pattern,
     avg(a.total_time) as avg_time,
     count(a) as attempt_count,
     sum(CASE WHEN a.success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / count(a) as success_rate

// Find matching cluster:
MATCH (cluster:PerformanceCluster {pattern_id: pattern.id})
WHERE abs(cluster.avg_time - avg_time) < 30
  AND abs(cluster.success_rate - success_rate) < 0.15
RETURN cluster

// Assign student to cluster:
CREATE (s)-[:BELONGS_TO {
  assignment_confidence: 0.87,
  assigned_at: datetime()
}]->(cluster)
```

**Benefits**:
- Student classified into 1 of ~10 clusters
- Clusters have aggregated metrics
- 10,000 students → 10 clusters (reuse)

### 2. Get Optimal Scaffolding for Student

```cypher
// Query student's cluster optimal pattern:
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})
      -[:BELONGS_TO]->(cluster:PerformanceCluster)
      -[:OPTIMAL_PATTERN]->(pattern:ScaffoldPattern)
RETURN pattern.id, pattern.difficulty, pattern.steps

// Returns: Proven effective pattern for this cluster
```

**Reuse**:
- Pattern used by 247 students in cluster
- Avg success rate: 0.82
- Not creating new pattern per student

### 3. Recommend Next Concepts

**Combines Neo4j dependencies + Student mastery**:

```cypher
// Find concepts ready to learn:
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})-[:MASTERED]->(mastered:Concept)
      <-[:REQUIRES]-(available:Concept)
WHERE NOT (s)-[:MASTERED]->(available)
WITH available, count(mastered) as prereqs_mastered

// Check if ALL prerequisites mastered:
MATCH (available)-[:REQUIRES]->(prereq:Concept)
WITH available, prereqs_mastered, count(prereq) as total_prereqs
WHERE prereqs_mastered >= total_prereqs

// Get cluster recommendation:
MATCH (s)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(cluster:PerformanceCluster)
WHERE available.id IN cluster.recommended_next_concepts

RETURN available.id, available.name, available.difficulty
ORDER BY available.difficulty
```

**Result**: Concepts student can learn + cluster recommendations

### 4. Update Cluster Metrics (After Student Completion)

```cypher
// Student completed problem:
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:PerformanceCluster)

// Update aggregated metrics (running average):
SET c.avg_time = (c.avg_time * c.student_count + $new_time) / (c.student_count + 1),
    c.success_rate = (c.success_rate * c.student_count + $success) / (c.student_count + 1),
    c.updated_at = datetime()

// Update common mistakes (if mistake occurred):
SET c.common_mistakes = c.common_mistakes + [$new_mistake_type]
```

**Data storage**:
- NOT storing individual student's full attempt data
- Updating cluster aggregates
- Minimal individual data (just references)

### 5. Match Learning Patterns

```cypher
// Find students with similar patterns:
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})-[a:ATTEMPTED]->(p:Problem)
WITH s, collect({
  time: a.total_time,
  success: a.success,
  mistakes: a.mistakes
}) as attempt_pattern

// Find LearningPattern that matches:
MATCH (lp:LearningPattern)
WHERE [condition matches attempt_pattern]

CREATE (s)-[:MATCHES]->(lp)
RETURN lp.description, lp.applicable_to, lp.success_rate_improvement
```

**Pattern reuse**:
- 156 students match "struggle_then_succeed" pattern
- All get similar personalized approach
- Not creating unique approach per student

## Personalization via Clusters

**How it works**:

```
Student 123 completes problem:
→ Classify into cluster_medium (based on performance)
→ cluster_medium has optimal_pattern: 'pf_standard_v1'
→ cluster_medium.effective_hints: [1, 3] (skip hint 2)

Next problem for student 123:
→ Use pattern 'pf_standard_v1'
→ Provide hints 1 and 3 only
→ Expect avg_time: 115s (cluster average)

Measurement:
→ Student takes 110s (faster than cluster avg)
→ Maybe student ready for cluster_high? 
→ Dynamic tier analyzes and may reclassify
```

## Connecting Dependencies with Personalization

**Problem**: Neo4j has concept dependencies. How to personalize?

**Solution**: Query both, combine in logic:

```cypher
// Step 1: Get ready concepts (dependency-based)
MATCH (s:Student {id: $student_id})-[:MASTERED]->(m:Concept)
      <-[:REQUIRES]-(available:Concept)
WHERE NOT (s)-[:MASTERED]->(available)

// Step 2: Filter by cluster recommendation (personalization)
MATCH (s)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(cluster:PerformanceCluster)
WHERE available.id IN cluster.recommended_next_concepts

// Step 3: Get optimal scaffolding for cluster
MATCH (cluster)-[:OPTIMAL_PATTERN]->(pattern:ScaffoldPattern)
      -[:FOR_CONCEPT]->(available)

RETURN available, pattern

// Result: Personalized next concept + proven scaffolding
```

## Tools Available

- Task (delegate to neo4j-query-agent)
- mcp__neo4j__query (direct graph queries)
- mcp__neo4j__update_node (update cluster metrics)
- Read, Write (data processing)
- TodoWrite (progress tracking)

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Students classified into clusters (not isolated)
2. ✅ Cluster metrics aggregated (not raw per-student)
3. ✅ Patterns reused (80%+ reuse rate)
4. ✅ Recommendations combine dependencies + personalization
5. ✅ Data storage efficient (<1M nodes for 10K students)

## Output Format

  1. prime_factorization
     - Prerequisites: 100% mastered (prime, exponents)
     - Difficulty: 6/10
     - Pattern: pf_standard_v1 (proven for cluster)
     
  2. gcd  
     - Prerequisites: 90% mastered (needs prime_fact)
     - Difficulty: 5/10
     - Pattern: gcd_standard_v1

     - Difficulty: 5/10

Recommendation: Start with #1 (prime_factorization)
  Using pattern: pf_standard_v1 (82% success in cluster)
  Expected time: ~115s
  Scaffolding level: Medium (5 steps)
