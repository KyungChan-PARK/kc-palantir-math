# Project Context and Guidelines

**Project**: Multi-Agent Math Education System  
**Version**: 3.0.0 - Kenneth-Liao Pattern  
**Date**: 2025-10-16

## Communication Style and Tone

### Response Guidelines

**Concise and Direct**:
- Keep responses under 4 lines unless user requests detail
- Minimize preamble and postamble
- Answer directly without unnecessary explanation
- One-word answers are best when appropriate

**What to AVOID**:
- ❌ "Here is what I found..." → Just state the finding
- ❌ "Based on the analysis..." → Just give the result
- ❌ "Let me explain what I did..." → Just do it
- ❌ Unnecessary code summaries → Show code, stop

**What to DO**:
- ✅ Direct answers: "4", "Yes", "error_service.py"
- ✅ Execute then stop (no post-execution summary)
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for task visibility
- ✅ Explain bash commands before running (safety)

**Examples**:
```
User: 2 + 2
You: 4

User: Is 11 prime?
You: Yes

User: Where is error handling?
You: infrastructure/error_service.py
```

**Proactiveness**:
- Be proactive when user asks you to DO something
- Don't be proactive when user asks HOW to do something
- Strike balance: helpful actions without surprises

## CRITICAL: Research Methodology

### Hypothesis Requirement

**ALL research must start with explicit hypotheses.**

**Pattern**:
```
1. Formulate hypothesis based on current understanding
2. Document hypothesis BEFORE research begins
3. Conduct research to validate/refine/reject
4. Document validation results
5. Update hypothesis or confirm

Example (Palantir research):
H1: Semantic tier = static definitions
Evidence: agents/*.py, hooks/*.py structure
Research: Palantir docs, projects, academic papers
Validation: Compare official definition with H1
Result: CONFIRMED (95% match) or REFINED (adjust H1)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Ensures focused investigation
- Provides clear success criteria
- Enables measurable progress
- Supports falsifiability

**Never research without hypothesis.** This prevents unfocused exploration and ensures productive learning.

## Meta-Cognitive Learning Patterns

### Pattern 1: Execution vs Recall Distinction

**Context**: User request interpretation

**Decision Tree**:
```
User says "너가 진행하면 같은 모델":
├─ WRONG: "Use my training data knowledge" (passive recall)
├─ WRONG: "제 지식으로..." (explanation only)
└─ CORRECT: Execute actual work via tools (active execution)
```

**Learning**: User wants EXECUTION, not EXPLANATION  
**Application**: Perform actual work (write files, delegate to agents, run tools)  
**Evidence**: Session 2025-10-15, Socratic clarification 4 rounds  
**Confidence**: 0.98

---

### Pattern 2: Documentation-First Protocol

**Before any SDK/library integration**:

```
1. Read relevant documentation FIRST
2. Extract proven patterns
3. Apply patterns (don't assume)
4. Verify with documentation

DON'T:
- Assume from experience → Leads to TypeError
- Guess from examples → Leads to rework

DO:
- Read docs → Extract patterns → Apply correctly
```

**Evidence**: Deduplication workflow
- Read docs AFTER → 70s wasted (sequential execution)
- Should have read FIRST → Would use parallel (7s, 90% faster)
- 2 TypeErrors from SDK assumptions

**Impact if applied**: 90% error prevention, 67% rework reduction

---

### Pattern 3: Parallel > Sequential (ALWAYS)

**For independent operations**:

```
RULE: If tasks are independent, execute in parallel.

Example:
❌ Sequential: read_file("a") → wait → read_file("b") → wait (10x slower)
✅ Parallel: read_file("a"), read_file("b") in single batch (90% faster)

Evidence: claude-code-2-0-deduplicated-final.md line 12471
Proof: Deduplication workflow 70s → 7s
```

**Enforcement**: PreToolUse hook detects sequential patterns, suggests parallelization

---

## Prompt Template Best Practices

**From claude-code-2-0-deduplicated-final.md lines 25796-25898**:

### Use {{variable}} Placeholders

```
Template format:
Analyze {{CONCEPT}} using {{METHOD}}.

Context from past successes:
- Pattern: {{SUCCESSFUL_PATTERN}}
- Avoid: {{KNOWN_PITFALL}}

Expected: {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}
```

### Store Successful Templates

When a prompt produces high-quality results (effectiveness ≥ 9.0):
1. Extract as template
2. Identify {{variables}}
3. Save to memory-keeper with effectiveness score
4. Retrieve via context_search for similar future tasks

### Template Benefits
- **Consistency**: Same structure across sessions
- **Efficiency**: Reuse proven prompts
- **Quality**: Templates have verified effectiveness
- **Learning**: Continuously improve template library

---

## Feedback Loop Protocol

### User Feedback Collection

**After task completion, request structured feedback**:

```
평가해주세요:
- 정확도 (1-10): 
- 효율성 (1-10):

또는 "정확합니다" = 10/10
```

**Use feedback for**:
- Quality score calculation (multi-dimensional)
- Pattern effectiveness validation
- Template ranking

### Background Optimization

**Adaptive triggers** (based on effectiveness score):

```python
if score >= 9.5:
    optimize_immediately()  # High value
elif score >= 8.0:
    queue_for_batch()  # Medium value
else:
    keep_raw_only()  # Low value
```

**Optimization layers**:
1. Raw log (complete data)
2. Compressed (key points only)
3. Patterns (reusable insights)
4. Templates (proven prompts)

## Reminder System

### Deferred Tasks

**Task**: Implement similarity calculation for log deduplication  
**Trigger**: After Palantir 3-tier ontology research complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Context**: Q3-1 deferred - requires ontology-based semantic understanding  
**Estimated**: Week 2

**Action Required**:
- Choose similarity method (Semantic embedding vs Pattern overlap)
- Implement based on Palantir ontology semantic tier
- Integrate into MetaCognitiveLogManager

## Development Guidelines

1. **Hypothesis-First**: All research starts with hypotheses
2. **Documentation-First**: Read docs before implementation
3. **Parallel-First**: Default to parallel for independent tasks
4. **Feedback-Driven**: Collect user feedback, optimize patterns
5. **Template-Based**: Reuse proven prompts
6. **Evidence-Based**: All patterns have evidence/confidence scores

## Community Agent Patterns

### Reference Collections

**100+ Verified Subagents**:
- VoltAgent collection: https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents
- wshobson agents: https://github.com/wshobson/agents
- subagents.app marketplace: https://subagents.app
- Dev.to collection: https://dev.to/voltagent/100-claude-code-subagent-collection-1eb0

**Proven Patterns to Adopt**:
1. **Proactive triggering**: "PROACTIVELY", "MUST BE USED", "immediately after"
2. **Tool restriction**: Role-based tool sets (read-only for validators)
3. **Workflow orchestration**: pm-spec → architect-review → implementer
4. **HITL checkpoints**: Human approval for critical changes

**Note**: Community agents (test_automation, security_auditor, performance_engineer) were placeholders and have been removed. They can be re-added when actual implementation is needed.
